# Matrix

## When should I use this program?
Well, if you are tring to calculate the determinant of a square matrix, this program are made for you!!

## How to use it?
Easy! You just have to call and say the size of the matrix. I'll assume you're trying to use a square matrix, so you just need to pass one value, intead of the two dimentions (Wrong: 2x2 / Right: 2):

    Matrix 2

to call a 2x2 matrix

***(yes, you can't calculate a assimetrical matrix... for now)***

---

Now, the progam will guide you to enter the correct value in the correct position, like this:

    Line 1:
    Enter the element 1: 4   <-- value that you have passed
    Enter the element 2: 10  <-- value that you have passed

    Line 2:
    Enter the element 1: 50  <-- value that you have passed
    Enter the element 2: 100 <-- value that you have passed

So, when you finished to enter the values to the program, it will show the matrix...

    [  4][ 10]
    [ 50][100]

...and print the determinant:

    The determinant of the matrix is: -100

So that's it, enjoy!
